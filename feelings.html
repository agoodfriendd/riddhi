            <p><strong>Your feelings were never a game.</strong> They were real, vulnerable, and precious. And I disrespected them completely.</p>
            
            <div class="emphasis">
                <p>I made you feel foolish for caring. I made you question whether you could trust your own heart. That is unforgivable.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>Your feelings deserved to be cherished, protected, and honored. Instead, I mocked them for my own amusement. I hurt you, and I can never take that back.</p>
