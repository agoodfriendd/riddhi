        <h1>You Deserve So Much Better</h1>

        <div class="apology">
            <p><strong>You deserve so much better than how I treated you.</strong> You deserve someone who protects your heart, honors your trust, and chooses kindness over cruelty.</p>
            
            <div class="emphasis">
                <p>You deserve better than me. That's not self-pity—it's acknowledging the truth of how I treated you compared to how you should be treated.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>You are worthy of love, respect, and genuine care. Please don't let what I did make you doubt yourself. The failure here was mine, not yours.</p>
            
            <p>Whatever you decide about me—that's entirely your choice, and it will be the right one. Your needs and your healing come first.</p>
            
            <p>Thank you for reading this. Take all the time you need.</p>

            I will understand and respect whatever you decide.<br>
            Take care of yourself, Riddhi. You deserve peace and happiness.
