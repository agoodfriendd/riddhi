        <h1>About Your Trauma</h1>

        <div class="apology">
            <p><strong>I triggered your past trauma.</strong> I knew about the pain you've carried and the strength it took for you to trust again. Despite knowing this, I was careless with your heart.</p>
            
            <div class="emphasis">
                <p>I became another person who hurt you. I became part of the pain you've been trying to heal from.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>Your trauma is real, your pain is valid, and you have every right to feel hurt, angry, and betrayed. Your healing matters. Your peace matters.</p>
